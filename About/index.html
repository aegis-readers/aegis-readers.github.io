<p>This is Advanced rEading Group in Information Science. We are a group of fresh PhD students interested in a variety of topics in Computer Science, with a special focus on Information Security, Computer Systems and Architecture. This group was founded in March, 2020, and we successfully arranged our first webinar in late June, 2020. </p>
<p>Hoping to improve our presentation skills and learning from outstanding fellows and peers, we try to introduce state-of-the-art (s.t.o.a.) papers, share our research works, and provide our systemizations of knowledge.</p>
<p>We arrange the talk in two sessions: he first session is the Sword Session that focus on Mobile, IoT, and other topics in Computer Security. The second session is the Shield Session that focus widely on Computer System and Archinecture. Normally, the webinar is arranged twice a week, in Sunday morning and Monday morning separately (GMT+8). However, due to the schedule of organizers and talkers are often unbounded, this regular time is subject to change.  At each Tuesday to Thursday, talkers and topics will be decided and released. Due to some reason, we no longer publish our video recordings and slides in this website, but recordings may be published in our wechat group, if talkers would like to.</p>
<p>For any suggestions on the arrangements, topics, websites, please feel free to file an issue at our corresponding Github repository <a href="https://github.com/aegis-readers/aegis-readers.github.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>P.S. AEGIS is the shield used by Zeus.<br>P.P.S. Mobile, Architecture, Security, and Systems can be denoted as M.A.S.S.<br>P.P.P.S. The official name of the webinar should be AEGIS M.A.S.S. Webinar.<br>P.P.P.P.S. But that was too long, just like these postscripts. :P</p>
