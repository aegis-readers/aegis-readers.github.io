          <h3 class="recent-title">Your Code Secret Belongs to Me: Neural Code Completion Tools Can Memorize Hard-Coded Credentials</h3>

        <h5>Abstract:</h5>
        <p>The abstract of her talk is shown below:</p>
        <p>Neural Code Completion Tools (NCCTs) have reshaped the eld of software engineering, which are built upon the language models and can accurately suggest contextualized code snippets. However, language models may emit the training data verbatim during inference with appropriate prompts. This memorization property raises privacy concerns of NCCTs about hard-coded credential leakage, leading to unauthorized access to applications, systems, or networks. Therefore, to answer whether NCCTs will emit the hard-coded credential, we propose an evaluation tool called Hard-coded Credential Revealer (HCR). </p>
        <p>HCR constructs test prompts based on GitHub code les with credentials to reveal the memorization phenomenon of NCCTs. Then, HCR designs four filters to filter out ill-formatted credentials. Finally, HCR directly checks the validity of a set of non-sensitive credentials. </p>
        <p>We apply HCR to evaluate three representative types of NCCTs: Commercial NCCTs, open-source models, and chatbots with code completion capability. Our experimental results show that NCCTs can not only return the precise piece of their training data but also inadvertently leak additional secret strings. Notably, two valid credentials were identied during our experiments. Therefore, HCR raises a severe privacy concern about the potential leakage of hard-coded credentials in the training data of commercial NCCTs.</p>
